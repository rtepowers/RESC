# RESC
## Ray's Easily Scaled Chat

This repo will contain the necessary components to building and using
an incredibly simple but scalable chat system. 

The goal is handle server failures like a champ and to offer powerful
features to be utilized by the RESC clients.

My goal is to service enable several popular APIs through the
RESC Server. Eventually, this will be a backend for web and mobile
applicaitons.
